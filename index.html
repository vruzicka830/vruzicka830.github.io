      <h3>Research</h3>
	<p>I study operator algebras. I proved (with Chunguang Li and Zhuang Niu) that the 
Villadsen algebras of the first type are singly generated. The paper discussing this result
has been submited to the Journal of Noncommutative Geometry.</p>

      <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>I was born in Milwaukee, WI and grew up about 20 miles north of Milwaukee in Cedarburg, WI. I received an undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics, Engineering,
        and Physics (<a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/applied-mathematics-engineering-physics-bs-amep/" class="custom-link2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BS AMEP</a>) from the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison in 2018.
        After graduating, I worked as an engineer at National Electrostatics
        Corporation (<a href="https://www.pelletron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEC</a>)
        in Middleton, WI where I helped design particle 
        accelerator systems. I left NEC in the fall of 2020 to study math at the University of Wyoming.<p>
